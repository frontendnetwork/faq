# FEN MetaTag Documentation

Welcome to the FEN (FrontendNetwork) MetaTag Documentation ðŸŽ‰ â€” a continually evolving repository of all Meta-Tags and Meta-Extensions in the realm of the World Wide Web and HTML. This invaluable resource aims to serve as a cornerstone for web developers, SEO professionals, and digital enthusiasts who strive to understand or implement meta-tags in their projects.

## What are Meta-Tags and why are they important?

Meta-tags are snippets of text that describe a webpage's content but are not displayed on the page itself. Instead, they are embedded within the page's HTML code. While not directly visible to users, they play a significant role in how search engines index your webpages and how your content appears in search engine results, among other things. Meta-tags can include information such as the [author](metatags/Miscellaneous/author) of the webpage, [how frequently the webpage should be updated](metatags/SEO/revisit-after), what the [webpage is about](metatags/SEO/description), and which [keywords](metatags/Miscellaneous/keywords) represent the webpage's content.

## From Jokenetwork FAQ to FEN MetaTag Documentation

Formerly known as the Jokenetwork FAQ, this compilation has come a long way. We initially aimed to contribute to the [WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)](WHATWG) Wiki, a community specializing in developing web standards. Our contributions have been used in the W3 HTML Validator, a tool that checks web documents in formats like HTML and XHTML for conformance to W3C recommendations and other standards. The evolution to FEN MetaTag Documentation signifies a broadening of scope and commitment to providing a comprehensive guide to meta-tags.

## Your Involved Role

The world of the internet is ever-changing, and so is the importance and functionality of meta-tags. As this is an ever-growing collection, we invite you to be a part of this exciting journey. If you have insights, updates, or would like to share knowledge about new meta-tags and extensions, feel free to contribute via GitHub.

In summary, the FEN MetaTag Documentation is not just a guide but a dynamic resource meant to adapt and evolve with the rapidly changing digital landscape. We hope you find it beneficial for your projects and professional endeavors.
