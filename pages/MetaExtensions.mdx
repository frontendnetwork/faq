# What are Meta-Tags and why are they important?

Meta-tags are snippets of text that describe a webpage's content but are not displayed on the page itself. Instead, they are embedded within the page's HTML code. While not directly visible to users, they play a significant role in how search engines index your webpages and how your content appears in search engine results, among other things. Meta-tags can include information such as the [author](metatags/Miscellaneous/author) of the webpage, [how frequently the webpage should be updated](metatags/SEO/revisit-after), what the [webpage is about](metatags/SEO/description), and which [keywords](metatags/Miscellaneous/keywords) represent the webpage's content.

## About MetaTags

The `<meta>` tag defines metadata about a HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about other data (in case of HTML information about the HTML-document).

`<meta>`-tags are always placed in the `<head>`-section of a HTML document and are used to specify metadata about a page, such as the charset (most likely UTF-8), a page description or the pages author.

Metadata can also be used to verify page-ownership (prominently used by Google as [`google-site-verification`]([/metatags/Google/google-site-verification))), or to en- or disable certain functions of a browser.

Metadata is not displayed on the page itself, and is therefore not intended for the end-user, but is **machine parsable**.

That means that

- **search engines**, such as Google, use Metadata to gather additional information about a page,
- **browsers** use Metadata to know how to display content (or even reload the page / follow a redirection) and
- **other web services** use Metadata for a variety of purposes.

### Examples for MetaTags

`<meta>`-tags may look something like this in your `<head>` section:

import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

<Tabs items={['HTML', 'JSX', 'PUG', 'HAML']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```html
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="language" content="en" />
        <meta name="description" content="JokeNetworks FAQ" />
        <meta name="keywords" content="Documentation, FAQ, MetaTags, HTML, WHATWG" />
        <meta name="author" content="JokeNetwork" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />
        <meta name="revisit" content="10 days" />
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10" />
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=https://faq.frontendnet.work" />
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```jsx
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta httpEquiv="language" content="en" />
        <meta name="description" content="JokeNetworks FAQ" />
        <meta name="keywords" content="Documentation, FAQ, MetaTags, HTML, WHATWG" />
        <meta name="author" content="JokeNetwork" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />
        <meta name="revisit" content="10 days" />
        <meta httpEquiv="refresh" content="10" />
        <meta httpEquiv="refresh" content="5;url=https://faq.frontendnet.work" />
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```pug
        meta(charset='UTF-8')
        meta(http-equiv='language' content='en')
        meta(name='description' content='JokeNetworks FAQ')
        meta(name='keywords' content='Documentation, FAQ, MetaTags, HTML, WHATWG')
        meta(name='author' content='JokeNetwork')
        meta(name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0')
        meta(name='robots' content='noindex,nofollow')
        meta(name='revisit' content='10 days')
        meta(http-equiv='refresh' content='10')
        meta(http-equiv='refresh' content='5;url=https://faq.frontendnet.work')
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```haml
        %meta{charset: "UTF-8"}/
        %meta{content: "en", "http-equiv" => "language"}/
        %meta{content: "JokeNetworks FAQ", name: "description"}/
        %meta{content: "Documentation, FAQ, MetaTags, HTML, WHATWG", name: "keywords"}/
        %meta{content: "JokeNetwork", name: "author"}/
        %meta{content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", name: "viewport"}/
        %meta{content: "noindex,nofollow", name: "robots"}/
        %meta{content: "10 days", name: "revisit"}/
        %meta{content: "10", "http-equiv" => "refresh"}/
        %meta{content: "5;url=https://faq.frontendnet.work", "http-equiv" => "refresh"}/
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Using MetaTags for SEO

Some `<meta>`-tags are relevant for search engine optimazation.

A full overview over MetaTags which are understood by Google and other search engines is listed on a [Google Search Central Page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/special-tags).

**⚠️ Please note:**
While `name="keywords"` is marked as <span class="badge bg-secondary">Deprecated</span> and is therefore not relevant anymore,
`name="description"` is not fully ignored by search enginges, but Google encourages you to put more effort into your pages content instead of describing it through the description-extension.

## About MetaExtensions

Meta Extensions are extension values for the `name=""` attribute of the HTML `<meta>` element and are the main subject of the Docs at [faq.jokenetwork.de](/).

The `name=""`attributes for the `<meta>`-tags should be well documented to be understood by everyone and listed as "_Proposal_" in the [WHATWG Wiki](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions).

~~Also, if they should not be marked as an error in the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), they have to be added from the WHATWG Wiki to the Validator.~~

Learn more about adding a MetaExtension to the WHATWG Wiki and to the W3 Validator here: [Contribute](README#Contribute).
