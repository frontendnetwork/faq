## MetaExtension description

## Usage

````html
<meta name="description" content="FEN Docs for WHATWG MetaExtensions">
````

`content` should be &le;165 characters, since search engines (e.g. Google) are typically showing only this amount of characters. 

## Result

import Search from '../../../components/Search';

<Search title="FEN MetaTag Documentation" url="https://faq.frontendnet.work" chevron description="FEN Docs for WHATWG MetaExtensions" />
