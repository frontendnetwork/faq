## MetaExtension apple-mobile-web-app-capable

The apple-mobile-web-app-capable metatag defines wether a website/webapp which was added to the homescreen can run in fullscreen or not.

In favor of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), this does not work anymore and is therefore marked as <span class="badge bg-danger">Unsupported</span>.

## Usage

````html
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
````


`content` can also be `false`, but the meta-tag is obsolete then.
