## MetaExtension abstract 

Is used to show a short text snippet in search engines. 

Seems not to work anymore, which is why it's marked as <span class="badge bg-danger">Obsolete</span>.

## Usage

````html
<meta name="abstract" content="Brief summary of your page">
````

Also refer to [description](description.md), [subject](subject.md) and [summary](summary.md).
