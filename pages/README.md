If you want to add your meta-extensions to the WhatWG-Wiki, please register on [WHATWG Wiki](https://wiki.whatwg.org/).

Then go to [Registry `<meta name>`](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions), edit the page and add your meta tag (in alphabetical order!).
You can link to https://faq.jokenetwork.de/[your-metaextension] (**Please note that file-names are case-sensitive!**) for the documentation of your meta-tag (Only if you created them before).

### Add extension to W3 Validator

Just send an e-mail to [www-validator@w3.org](mailto:www-validator@w3.org), informing the W3 about the meta-tag you added to the WHATWG Wiki, their purpose, and state that you added them to the WHATWG Wiki.
