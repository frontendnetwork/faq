## MetaExtension no-email-collection

The no-email-collection metatag was used to tell site-scrapers and spammers that you don't want them to save and/or collect e-mail-adresses from your site. 

Since spammers did not care about that tag at all, it is marked as <span class="badge bg-danger">Unsupported</span>.

This tag was an initative of [unspam.com](https://www.unspam.com).

## Usage

````html
<meta name="no-email-collection" content="Your own terms">
<meta name="no-email-collection" content="https://www.unspam.com/noemailcollection/">
````


`content` can be your own terms on e-mail-collection or the unspam-terms.
