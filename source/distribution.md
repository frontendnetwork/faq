Defines the level of distribution of your page.

Does not seem to be implemented anywhere, which is why it's marked as <span class="badge bg-danger">Obsolete</span>.

`content` may be:

- `web`  - inteded for everyone
- `global` - inteded for everyone
- `local` - local distribution
- `iu` - internal use

## Usage
